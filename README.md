A slush generator to scaffold an AWS Lambda function package and upload it to AWS.

This generator helps you to:
* scaffold your AWS Lambda solution;
* create / update / delete the AWS Lambda on your AWS account;
* invoke locally your AWS Lambda with a test payload;
* realtime log into your console all AWS CloudWatch Logs related to your AWS Lambda execution;

## Installation
First of all you have to globally install [Slush](http://slushjs.github.io/#/), the streaming scaffolding system.
```
npm install -g slush
```
then you have to install globally the slush-aws-lambda generator
```
npm install -g slush-aws-lambda
```

## Deployment
To create your solution you simply have to call the generator via the slush cli from the directory where you want to deploy your project
```
slush aws-lambda
```
Now you must provide some info about the project.
You can always insert this information manually later by modifying the solution package.json (both in the project and in the lambda src folder)

## Configuration
To use the slush-aws-lambda solution it's important that you have properly installed the [aws-cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) and
configured it with your credentials.

Then, from the folder of your project, run the command
```
gulp configure
```
You can set-up all settings of your AWS Lambda right now, or later at any time by calling this command again, or directly modifying the **lambda-config.json** and the **package.json** in lambda src folder

## Usage
All you have to do is to program your function inside the **src** folder; when you are done you can run the following commands:
* `gulp` || `gulp help` - List all gulp tasks and their descriptions;
* `gulp configure` - Set-up all settings of your AWS Lambda;
* `gulp install` - Installs npm packages inside the src folder;
* `gulp create` - wraps everything inside the src folder in a zip file and uploads it to AWS to create your new AWS Lambda using the configuration information you set in the **lambda-config.json** file;
* `gulp update` - works exactly the same as the previous command, but on an existing AWS Lambda;
* `gulp update-code` - same as above, but it only updates the code of your AWS Lambda without modifying the configuration;
* `gulp update-config` - only changes your AWS Lambda configuration, but not the code;
* `gulp delete` - deletes your AWS Lambda function;
* `gulp logs` - prints in the console all logs generated by you Lambda function in Amazon CloudWatch;
* `gulp invoke` - invokes the Lambda function passing test-payload.json as payload and printing the response to the console;
* `gulp invoke-local` ||  `npm test` ||  `node .` - invokes the Lambda function LOCALLY passing test-payload.json as payload and printing the response to the console;
